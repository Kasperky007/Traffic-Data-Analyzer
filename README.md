- Count the **number of empty lines** (no traffic)
- Detect the **maximum number of cars in one line**
- Count the **total number of traffic jams**
- Identify the **longest traffic jam** in the dataset

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- File I/O
- Looping & conditionals
- Modular design (separate files for each analysis)
